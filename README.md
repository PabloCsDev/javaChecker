# The program reads the student's name and enrollment number, then requests the grades of the 3 units studied, where together they have a maximum value of 100 points, the first is worth 30, the second and the third 35. There are some checks on whether the number is valid, whether it is within the range of acceptable grades or not. Soon after, the program makes the calculations, if the grade is greater than 60 points, the student receives the message of passed, otherwise he receives a message informing him that he failed and the number of points that were missing for his approval. Project made in Java!
